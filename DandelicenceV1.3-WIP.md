# Dandelicence

## A licence that works on good faith, because why can't we all just be friends instead of bickering?

### Version 1.3-WIP, 28th of August 2020

## Glossary

* Except where local laws and/or B's licences from §4 state otherwise, redistributions or borrowed content counts as
* * **Unmodified** if it has received 0 changes,
* * **Transformative work** if more than 20% of the lines or 20% of the sentences (whichever is more) have been altered from their original borrowing,
* * **Near-unmodified** if it is somewhere between those two categories.

For the purposes of section 4, if A believes that their content use has become transformative, A can optionally add a note about it in the 4c template for as long as B does not contest the claim.

* The British English version of this licence is the official version. All other translations are unofficial.

* A **country** is defined as a United Nations member state, the Republic of China, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's Free Zone, Vatican State, Kosovo, or Northern Cyprus.

## Licence text

Redistribution and use in all forms, with or without modification, with or without commercial purpose, are permitted as long as the following conditions are met:

1) Redistributions of (near-)unmodified source code must retain this licence text in unmodified form somewhere inside it.

2) The creator(s) of the original project/code may under no circumstances be held responsible for damages, incompatibilities, breakage or unmerchantability, except if the unmodified source code contained live ransomware/skimmingware. Likewise, anyone who modify the source code to add live ransomware/skimmingware that was not originally in the source code, can be held responsible for it.

3) The name(s) of the copyright/trademark holder or contributors may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without explicit prior written permission.

4) If a project with this licence (A), incorporates (near-)unmodified content from another project (B), then it's mandatory for A's official maintainer(s) to follow requests made by B that are about creditations of them or their project, and/or removal of that content. In return, B is expected to assume for ≥14 days after the request placement that A's official maintainer(s) will act in good faith and will perform the request within that timespan, and that DMCA claims and admin reports are to be kept at an absolute minimum for as long as A acts in good faith.

* * 4a. If B's project was licenced with a creditation requirement⁽¹⁾, it is expected that A will add creditation without needing to be told to do so, although the principle of asking about it and expecting good faith applies in this case as well.
* * 4b. If B's project was licenced with a share-alike clause⁽²⁾, then (near-)unmodified content that is taken from B shall be treated as still being licenced with B's licence.
* * 4c. A's owners can, through means of written text, donate and relicence any portion of their code to any other project even if it has not become transformative work, unless it's affected by 4b.

5) If a different licence is mentioned and used as the sole licence for an individual file in a multi-file project (e.g. a Git), then the file's licence takes sole precedence over the Dandelicence.

6) Transformative versions of the source code can be relicenced into any licence, but will remain subject to §2, §3 and §5.

* * 6a) If the relicenced source code was previously added to the source code from B, then §4 applies to such content as well.

7) Any (near-)unmodified redistributions of the source code, shall be accessible in some way in ≥100 countries worldwide⁽³⁾. VPN access does not count. If the work is not available in enough countries, any living person can request that A's maintainer must make it available in 10 more countries within 14 days. Once a 14-day period has finished, a new request can be placed, until 100 countries have been reached.

## Non-mandatory guidelines

* If it's feasible, the incorporated content from B is to be placed in its own section, and the following template or something similar should be used: *"Below are \<content> that [I/we] borrowed from \<the name of B>, which is maintained by \<link to B's maintainer> at \<link to B's project>, and which is licenced under \<B's licence>."*
* It is preferable to write the copyright sign as © instead of (C).
* Adding name/year copyright-info is optional, but a name or nickname to refer to the owner as, should be stated clearly in the licence and/or in the source code.
