## Alternate licence wording for projects based in politically sensitive areas

Section 10 in Dandelicence v1.1 (Section 9 in v1.2) normally mentions non-United-Nations countries by the countries' own preferred names. If your project is based in a country where you believe you'll be at risk of persecution if you use those original names, here's Dandelion Sprout's recommended alternate names:

| Original text | Permitted alternate text |
| - | - |
| Republic of China | Taiwan Area |
| The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's Free Zone | Morocco Southeast Autonomous Provinces |

It is permitted to use the alternate text even for non-transformative redistributions, as long as `-G` (short for "Geography") is added to the end of the version name, e.g. `v1.1-G` or `v1.2-WIP-G`.
