# Dandelicence

## A licence that works on good faith, because why can't we all just be friends instead of bickering?

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, with or without commercial intentions, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

1) Redistributions of unmodified or near-unmodified source code must retain this very licence in unmodified form somewhere inside it.

2) The creator(s) of the original project and source code may not under any possible circumstances be held responsible for damages, incompatibilities, breakage, or unmerchantability. The sole exception is if it can be decidedly proven beyond reasonable doubt that the original unmodified source code contained live ransomware or live skimmingware. Likewise, anyone who modifies the source code to contain live ransomware or live skimmingware that was not originally in the source code, can be held responsible for it.

3) Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

4) If a project that is licenced under the Dandelicence (A), incorporates verbatim or near-verbatim content from another project that is licenced under any reasonably open-sourced licence (B), then it is mandatory for the maintainer(s) of A to adhere to creator/licence creditation requests and/or requests to remove the incorporated content, from the owner(s) or substantial contributor(s) of B, as long as it can be reasonably assumed that the requestor really does own or contribute to B. In return, the requestor is expected to assume for at least 14 days after the request has been placed that the maintainer(s) of A will act in good faith, will include the creditation or perform the removal within that timespan, and that reports and DMCA takedowns are to be kept at an absolute minimum for as long as A acts in good faith.

* * 4a. To make it easier for the creator of A to demonstrate their good faith, creditation for incorporated content should be added as fast as humanly possible without the need for a request from B, if B's content was licenced under either GPLv3, GPLv2, MPLv2, CC BY, CC BY-NC, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC-SA, another licence that is strict on creditation, or was from a project that appears to not mention any licences or copyright policies of any sort. Content that is taken from such projects and credited, unless they have been changed enough to count as transformative work, is to be treated as still being licenced under B's licence.

* * 4b. If it's feasibly possible, the incorporated content from B is to be placed in its own paragraph, and the following template or something similar should be used: *"Below are \<content> that [I/we] borrowed from \<the name of B>, which is maintained by \<link to B's maintainer> at \<link to B's project>, and which is licenced under \<B's licence>."*

* * 4c. Content that was originally incorporated, but which has since been significantly transformed, are exempted from 4a and 4b, but not from 4.

5) Should there be incompatible disprecancies between different translations of this licence, then the British English version takes precedence.

6) Substantially modified versions of the source code does not require adding this licence to it, and can be relicenced into any licence. However, condition 2, 3, 5, and 6 in the Dandelicence will still apply to how the modified version relates to the source code.

7) If a different licence is mentioned and used as the sole licence for an individual file in a multi-file project (e.g. a Git), then the file's licence takes sole precedence over the Dandelicence.

8) It is merely optional for the Dandelicence-using project to list copyright details (e.g. name, year) in the licence file. However, it should be made clear in some or another way who the creator of the source code was, for example (but not limited to) through the project's homepage or FAQ page, even if it's just a fictional username. Should you wish to include the copyright details, they are written on the line beneath the version number/date line. It is preferable to use the Unicode character Â© instead of (C).

9) This licence was partially written as a contrast to those licences that shout at the top of lungs in all-caps about non-liability. It is therefore considered bad sport (although non-enforceably so) to change any section of this licence into all-caps.

10) The source code that is covered by the licence, and any redistributions of unmodified or near-unmodified source code, shall be accessible in some or another capacity at whichever access price in at least 100 countries worldwide. This is to try to prevent it from e.g. being solely accessible from United States-only streaming services or similarly restricted services. VPN access does not count towards the tally. A "country" is defined as a member state of the United Nations, or alternately the Republic of China, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's Free Zone, Vatican State, Kosovo, or Northern Cyprus. Should the work not be available in a sufficient amount of countries, any living person may request to the project's maintainer that it be made available in at least 10 more countries within 14 days. 14-day periods may be stacked through successive requests placed 14 or more days after the previous request, until 100 countries have been reached.
