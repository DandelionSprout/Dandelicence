# Dandelicence

My attempt at creating an open-source licence that works on good faith, specifically crafted for adblock filterlist maintainers.

As someone who previously used BSD-3 for my projects, I began to worry if tech geeks would take offence to it or not if I semi-automatically added content from other people's GPLv3 projects to them. So I created this licence instead.

<i>Important legal note:</i> The licence's legal value in a court of law is considered to be highly questionable when it comes to files with GPL or AGPL content (More info at https://github.com/DandelionSprout/Dandelicence/issues/2). Instead, it operates on the concept of ["Why can't we be friends?"](https://deezer.page.link/S6SM79bg7FqFmcfT7), by demonstrating crediting and good intent, especially when it comes to text files.
