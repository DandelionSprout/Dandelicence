# Dandelicence

My attempt at creating an open-source licence that works on good faith, specifically crafted for adblock filterlist maintainers.

As someone who previously used BSD-3 for my projects, I began to worry if tech geeks would take offence to it or not if I semi-automatically added content from other people's GPLv3 projects to them. So I created this licence instead.
